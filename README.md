# ReactiveProcess

Java 9 reactive streams implementation for processes

I implemented the [JVM reactive streams specification](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm) to learn how reactive processing frameworks (e.g. RxJava, Reactor) function.
This implementation allows you to process data in an external process.
It makes use of the [Java 9 Process api improvements](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/102).
